- [x] Update .gitignore to exclude environment files

### Build Configuration
- [x] Optimize Vite config for production
- [x] Add code splitting and manual chunks
- [x] Configure Terser minification
- [x] Add bundle size warnings and optimizations
- [x] Test production build successfully

### Deployment Pipeline
- [x] Create Vercel configuration
- [x] Add security headers and caching rules
- [x] Create deployment scripts in package.json
- [x] Set up environment-specific builds

### Error Monitoring
- [x] Install and configure Sentry
- [x] Add error boundaries and context tracking
- [x] Implement Nigerian business context logging
- [x] Add user context and performance monitoring

## üîÑ Phase 2: Next Steps for Full Production Readiness

### Performance Optimization (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [ ] Implement React.lazy() for route-based code splitting
- [ ] Add image optimization and lazy loading
- [ ] Optimize bundle size (current: 761KB main bundle needs reduction)
- [ ] Add service worker for caching
- [ ] Implement React Query optimizations

### Testing & Quality Assurance (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [ ] Add unit tests for critical business logic
- [ ] Implement E2E tests for user flows
- [ ] Load test with 100+ concurrent users
- [ ] Security penetration testing
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness testing

### Monitoring & Analytics (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- [ ] Set up Google Analytics
- [ ] Add uptime monitoring (Pingdom/UptimeRobot)
- [ ] Configure Web Vitals monitoring
- [ ] Set up error alerting via Slack/email
- [ ] Create performance dashboards

### Nigerian Market Features (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- [ ] Integrate Paystack payment gateway
- [ ] Add Flutterwave payment option
- [ ] Implement SMS verification (Twilio/Termii)
- [ ] Add Nigerian bank verification
- [ ] Implement offline capabilities

## üöÄ Current Production Readiness Status

### Security: ‚úÖ READY
- Environment variables secured
- Sentry error monitoring active
- Security headers configured
- Input validation implemented

### Performance: ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS WORK
- Bundle size needs optimization (>700KB)
- No code splitting at route level
- No image optimization
- No service worker caching

### Deployment: ‚úÖ READY
- Vercel config complete
- Environment management setup
- Build pipeline working
- Rollback strategy available

### Monitoring: üîÑ PARTIAL
- Error monitoring (Sentry) ‚úÖ
- Performance monitoring ‚ùå
- Analytics ‚ùå
- Uptime monitoring ‚ùå

## üìã Immediate Actions Required

### Before Deploying to Production:
1. **Set up Vercel project** and add environment variables
2. **Configure custom domain** (optional but recommended)
3. **Add Sentry DSN** to environment variables
4. **Test deployment** in staging environment first
5. **Set up basic monitoring** (at minimum uptime checks)

### Environment Variables to Set in Vercel:
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://hjtkhqmtupesaiyrkbrr.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
VITE_ENVIRONMENT=production
VITE_SENTRY_DSN=your_sentry_dsn
VITE_ENABLE_ERROR_MONITORING=true
VITE_ENABLE_ANALYTICS=false
VITE_ENABLE_DEBUG_MODE=false
```

## üéØ Production Launch Plan

### Week 1: Critical Fixes (Required before launch)
- Set up Vercel deployment
- Configure environment variables
- Add basic uptime monitoring
- Test all critical user flows

### Week 2-3: Performance & Monitoring
- Optimize bundle size
- Add comprehensive monitoring
- Implement analytics
- Load testing

### Week 4: Nigerian Features
- Payment gateway integration
- SMS verification
- Bank verification

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

### Current Bundle Size
- Main bundle: 761KB (should be <500KB)
- Needs route-based code splitting
- Image optimization required

### Missing Features for Nigerian Market
- No payment integration
- No SMS verification
- Limited offline support
- English-only interface

### Testing Coverage
- No automated tests
- No load testing
- No security testing

## üìä Success Metrics

### Performance Goals
- First Contentful Paint: <2s
- Largest Contentful Paint: <2.5s
- Cumulative Layout Shift: <0.1
- Bundle size: <500KB

### User Experience Goals
- 99.9% uptime
- <100ms API response times
- Mobile-responsive design
- Offline capability for basic features

## üÜò Emergency Procedures

### If Production Goes Down
1. Check Vercel deployment status
2. Review error logs in Sentry
3. Rollback to previous deployment
4. Check environment variables
5. Verify Supabase connection
