Time Banking for Commerce
Nigeria runs on relationships and favors, but there's no system for it.So I want to Create a parallel economy where businesses trade time and services, not just money.
A web designer needs legal services. A lawyer needs catering. A caterer needs web design. The platform automatically detects these loops and facilitates trades. But here's the innovation - make time fungible. One hour of legal work = 3 hours of catering = 2 hours of web design, based on market dynamics.
Suddenly, cash-strapped businesses can grow by trading what they have (time, skills) for what they need. It's especially powerful during economic downturns when cash is scarce but capacity exists.
Imagine Funke the Fashion Designer:
* She needs a lawyer (costs ₦50,000) ❌
* She has no cash right now ❌
* But she has TIME and SKILLS ✅
* She can make beautiful clothes ✅
Meanwhile, Barrister Chidi:
* Needs new suits for court (costs ₦50,000) ❌
* Has plenty of legal knowledge ✅
* Has free time in the evenings ✅
They both NEED something and HAVE something, but no money is exchanged.

The Solution - Dead Simple
TimeBank = Trade Time Instead of Money
Instead of: Funke → Pays ₦50,000 → Lawyer
We do: Funke → Gives 10 hours of fashion design → Lawyer Lawyer → Gives 5 hours of legal work → Funke
Why different hours?
* 1 hour of legal work = ₦10,000
* 1 hour of fashion design = ₦5,000
* So 5 legal hours = 10 fashion hours
* Fair trade!

The Magic: 3-Way Trades
Sometimes the app gets clever:


Kemi needs → Legal work
Chidi (lawyer) needs → Website
Tunde (developer) needs → Accounting
Kemi (accountant) provides → Accounting

THE APP FIGURES OUT:
Kemi → Accounting → Tunde
Tunde → Website → Chidi  
Chidi → Legal → Kemi
